# Despite Everything (WIP)
The game ends when you give up.

## Intended Features
We'll see how many actually get completed.

- Infinite runner game with scaling difficulty
- Three obstacle types
  - Heart: small obstacle that flies across screen
    - Maybe a collectible that increases score instead of an obstacle?
  - Bunny: medium obstacle that hops up and down
  - Bear: large obstacle that runs on the ground
- Player slows down and loses points after taking enough hits
  - Instead of player slowing down, maybe speed up spawns and such?
  - Player falls and needs to get up
- Art and music change as game progresses
  - Player looks more battered, obstacles look scarier, background color gets darker
  - Music gets more distorted?
  - Maybe get "GIVE UP?" text show up every once in a while
- ~~Online leaderboard~~ (doesn't serve purpose of game)
