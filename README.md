# Despite Everything (WIP)
The game ends when you give up.

## Intended Features
We'll see how many actually get completed.

- Infinite runner game with scaling difficulty
- Three obstacle types
  - Heart: small obstacle that flies across screen
  - Bunny: medium obstacle that hops up and down
  - Bear: large obstacle that runs on the ground
- Player slows down after taking enough hits
- Art and music change as game progresses
  - Player looks more battered, obstacles look scarier, background color darker
